# 🧩 Customer Segmentation — Superstore Analytics Dashboard

**Goal:** Analyze customer behavior and profitability across segments and regions using the Superstore dataset.  
The project explores how customer type, region, and discounts influence total sales and profit, helping identify high-value segments and business opportunities.

---

**Key Insights**
- **Corporate** customers generate the highest average profit.  
- Most customers make small purchases, but a few “power buyers” contribute a large share of revenue.  
- **High discounts** reduce profit margins significantly.  
- The **West** region leads in total sales and overall performance.  
- The **top 10 customers** are responsible for a major part of total profit — ideal for loyalty programs.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Dataset:** Superstore Sales (Kaggle)

**Next Steps**
- Build a **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** model.  
- Apply **KMeans clustering** or **RFM segmentation** to group customers by behavior.  
- Create an **interactive dashboard** to monitor sales, profit, and segment trends.
